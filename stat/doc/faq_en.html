    <h3><a name="faq39"></a>
      I inserted the code in my page, but no hits are counted
    </h3>
    <p>
      Please check that the file in which you inserted the code has the file extension ".php". The
      file extensions ".htm" or ".html" work on some servers, but if it does not work, you must
      rename the file to ".php" (all files in which the code is included / which should be counted).<br />
      If you do not want this (e.g. because many links had to be changed) you can also use an
      alternative code that works for ".htm" or ".html" files. There are two
      variants of the alternative code, one <a href="#faq32">for HTML pages</a> and one <a href="#faq33">for XHTML
      pages</a> that can be found in the FAQ.<br />
      If the file extension is ".php", check that all steps of the installation instructions have
      been followed correctly (please read the detailed explanation).

    <h3>
      <a name="faq1" id="faq1"></a>How do I convert a (counter) image to PNG graphics format?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The easiest way is using the following page: <a href=
      "http://graphic2png.christosoft.de/?lang=en">http://graphic2png.christosoft.de/?lang=en</a><br />
      Alternatively, you can download the free program IrfanView ( <a href=
      "http://www,irfanview.com/">http://www.irfanview.com/</a>). Just open the image and click "File" /
      "Save As" and select PNG as the file type.

    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="faq2" id="faq2"></a> How do I set CHMOD?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can do this in your FTP program. Just right-click the file and choose "chmod (Unix)" (WS_FTP95),
      "Change file attributes / Commands / FTP-Commands/CHMOD (Unix)" (WS_FTP Pro), "File Attributes"
      (FileZilla) or similar. 777 corresponds to full rights, so check all boxes.<br />
      If you work directly on the server running Linux/Unix, you can change the rights in your file manager
      such as Konqueror. Just right click the file and select Properties and then
      Permissions. Alternatively, you can use the chmod command in the shell (e.g. via ssh).
      Example: "chmod-R 777 stat/usr stat/src/log-tool". See "man chmod" for details.

    <h3>
      <a name="faq3" id="faq3"></a> How do I update from version 1.6x or 1.5x?
    </h3>
    <p>
      CrazyStat 1.6x and 1.5x were not available in English and therefore the
      update instructions will not be translated into English as there should be
      no CrazyStat 1.5x or 1.6x user who does not understand German. You can
      find the German instructions in the <a href="faq_de.html#faq3">German FAQ</a>.

    <h3>
      <a name="faq3" id="faq40"></a> How do I update from version 1.7x?
    </h3>
    <p>
       Replace the folders <b>"stat/src"</b> and <b>"stat/doc"</b> with the new ones. Make sure 
       "stat/src/log-tool" still has CHMOD 777. To get the newest presets, copy all files from
       <b>"stat/usr/presets"</b> from the new version into the "stat/usr/presets" folder of your installation.
       To get the newest detection files for browsers, operating systems, search engines and robots,
       copy all files from <b>"stat/usr/keywords"</b> from the new version into the "stat/usr/keywords" folder of
       your installation.<br />
       Clean the cache after updating.

    <h3>
      <a name="faq5" id="faq5"></a> How can I change user names, passwords, reset or create new
      users?<br />
      Or, "I forgot my password"<br />
      Or: "I changed <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_salt_str">$config_salt_str</a>
      and can not log in anymore"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The user-data is stored in the file "usr/config_pass.php" in the array
      <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_stat_user">$config_stat_user</a>.
      The file has the following structure:<br />
      <br />
      &lt;?php $config_salt_str = 'SomeRand0m_strlng'; $config_stat_user = array (<br />
      'admin' =&gt; '1a1dc91c907325c69271ddf0c944bc72',<br />
      ); ?&gt;<br />
      <br />
      The first line contains the <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_salt_str">"salt" string</a>,
      which is set to a random value on the first call
      of the login form automatically after the installation. This value should then not be
      changed. The first and last line of the file are therefore fix and should not be changed.
      In between, a line for each user is created. First comes the user name in quotes, then =&gt;
      and then the password in
      quotation marks. The password can be stored as an MD5 hash for security reasons (if
      <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_stat_password_md5">$config_stat_password_md5</a> = true).
      This is followed by a comma. So to create a new user, just add another line. Example:<br />
      <br />
      &lt;?php $config_salt_str = 'SomeRand0m_strlng'; $config_stat_user = array (<br />
      'user1' =&gt; '1a1dc91c907325c69271ddf0c944bc72',<br />
      'user2' =&gt; md5('password'.$config_salt_str),<br />
      );?&gt;<br />
      <br />
      If <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_stat_password_md5">$config_stat_password_md5</a>
      = true, all passwords must be stored as their MD5 hash. Nevertheless, you can add a new user
      simply by passing the password to the md5 function so that the hash is created
      (see example). However, this way the password is stored in the file in plain text and the encryption
      is useless. To increase security, you can now call show_stat.php and "change password" to
      assign the same (or another) password. This is then automatically stored encrypted.
      CrazyStat &gt;= 1.70 is using salted hashes to increase security even further, so you
      need to attach <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_salt_str">$config_salt_str</a> to the password
      before the MD5 hash is calculated (see example).
      This way, you can regain access to your statistics even if <a href=
      "config_settings_en.html#config_salt_str">$config_salt_str</a> has been changed manually
      or you forgot your password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attention! After a change of config_pass.php ensure that the file is chmod 777.

    <h3>
      <a name="faq6" id="faq6"></a> How do I reset the stats?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Just delete the log files. Log in to the statistics, click on the "Logs" (next to the logout
      button upper right). Select all the files and click the Delete icon.<br />
      Alternatively, you can delete the files via FTP / SSH. They are located by default in 
      "usr/logs" (the folder can be changed via <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_logfile_folder">$config_logfile_folder</a>).
      Delete all files in that folder except the .htaccess file, which protects your log files from being accessed by strangers.<br />
      If "Preset-File-Cache" is used, click the icon <strong>"Delete Cache"</strong> in statistics (flash
      icon at the top right) to empty the cache.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#top">Top</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="faq7" id="faq7"></a> What is the Counter-file "counter.log"?
    </h3>
    <p>
      CrazyStat stores three values in this file (one per line): position in the last log file from where
      blocked IPs may still start, total hits blocked by IP (visitors), total hits not blocked by IP
      (page views). <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_counter_add">$config_counter_add</a> is not yet
      added to these values. This
      information is used by CrazyStat to implement a fast counter, but is required even if the
      counter is disabled. You can read this data from your own scripts, for a simple text counter
      the built-in  is recommended.<br />
      This file is automatically created. If the value is incorrect, it will be adjusted when
      evaluating the statistics by show_stat.php. There is no need to have a backup of this
      file, since it can be generated automatically from the log files. This file is always created in the same
      directory as the log files. The directory has to be writable to create this file (CHMOD 777).
    </p>

    <h3>
      <a name="faq8" id="faq8"></a> In Internet Explorer, loading the statistics takes extremely
      long.<br />
      Or: In other browsers, loading the module "referrer" takes very long.
    </h3>
    <p>
      If loading the statistics in the Internet Explorer takes a long time, that is probably because
      Internet Explorer does not display the table with the results before it is completely loaded.
      If loads of referers or files must be loaded, this can be extremely time-consuming. Especially
      when using the plugin "mktree" for the display of the referers, a lot of data has to be loaded
      before Internet Explorer can display the results. In this case, it is advisable to use the
      AjaxTree plugin. To enforce AjaxTree just set
      <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_stat_tree">$config_stat_tree</a> = "ajax". Alternatively set
      <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_stat_referer_tree">$config_stat_referer_tree</a> =
      false to disable tree view by default.

    <h3>
      <a name="faq9" id="faq9"></a> What does <a href=
      "config_settings_en.html#config_xhtml">$config_xhtml</a> change?
    </h3>
    <p>
      If this setting is true, CrazyStat will not use the document.write javascript-command for
      integration because it is no longer allowed in XHTML. Instead, 
      "document.getElementById" or "document.all" is used to include the statistics. Please note that this type
      of integration is allowed in XHTML, but (really) old browsers might have problems with this
      and might not be counted. So that a visitor is recorded, its browser must be capable of:<br />
      - document.getElementById("id") or document.all("id")<br />
      - The JavaScript event handler window.onload = function;
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="faq10" id="faq10"></a> What is different in the log format 1.6?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Both CrazyStat 1.6x and 1.7x use the log-format 1.6. It is more compact than the format 1.5
      which in CrazyStat 1.5x was used, although it does not store less data. E.g. date and time
      are not stored anymore but are calculated from the timestamp when CrazStat is analyzing the
      logs. Thus, the log file will is smaller by up to 20%. The evaluation of the new log files
      can take a little longer. Log files can be converted using the CrazyStat log-tool
      (only in German yet). CrazyStat &gt;= 1.70 no longer supports the "compression" from version 1.6x, but
      real gz compression (see next question).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#top">Top</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="faq11" id="faq11"></a> What is "compression", gz compression and zlib?
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Compression" was a simple procedure that was used in CrazyStat 1.6x to make logs of
      the 1.6 format by up to 50% smaller. This was achieved by not storing data which is
      identical with the line above. CrazyStat 1.7x now (only) supports
      real compression in gz format ("gz-compression" or "zlib-compression"), which allows
      much higher compression ratios. The gz compression is enabled by <a href=
      "config_settings_en.html#config_log_zlib">$config_log_zlib</a> (default). It will
      always compress a logfile when a new log file is created (the last log file is not
      compressed for performance reasons). You should always use splitting (see
      <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_logfile_maxsize">$config_logfile_maxsize</a>
      ) when using gzip-compression.<br />
      You can use CrazyStat log-tool (only German yet) to compress or decompress log files.

    <h3>
      <a name="faq12" id="faq12"></a> How do I use the CrazyStat log tool and what is it for?
    </h3>
    <p><i>Note: Up to the release of CrazStat 1.70, the log-tool has not yet been translated
      into English so it is only available in German yet. This is because the log-tool is
      mostly needed when upgrading from older versions. Maybe a translated version of the
      logtool has been released by now and is available <a href="http://en.christosoft.de">online</a>.
    </i></p>
    <p>
      The log tool allows you to convert CrazyStat log files of different formats, compress or
      decompress, split or join them and subsequently make IPs anonymous. The log tool
      does not analyze the log files (CrazyStat is responsible for that).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is located in "src/log-tool". If you have already uploaded CrazyStat 1.7x to a web
      server, set the CHMOD of the folder "log-tool" to 777, if you have not already (see <a href=
      "#faq2">FAQ</a>). Call it then (http://example.com/stat/src/log-tool/) and enter user and
      password. If you only want to run the logtool, you can use the standalone version, which
      is available online <a href="http://en.christosoft.de/Download">http://en.christosoft.de/Download</a>.

    </h3>
    <p>
      If you log in and select this box, a cookie is placed on your computer. This is a small
      file that is automatically deleted if you do not log in 30 days with this option. When you
      visit your page, it is checked whether this file exists. If it does, your call is not written in
      the log file. Moreover, the text "cookie" (or what you set in <a href=
      "config_settings_en.html#config_counter_cookie_text">$config_counter_cookie_text</a>)
      appears in the counter. The properties of the "cookie" text match those of the reload-text,
      they can be adjusted in "config.php". To hide the text, simply set <a href=
      "config_settings_en.html#config_counter_cookie_text">$config_counter_cookie_text</a> false.

      You put the following setting into "config.php":<br />
      <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_different_rel_paths">$config_different_rel_paths</a> = true;<br />
      Suppose that the statistic is in the folder "stat". You now want to include it in the file
      "picture1.php" in the "pictures" folder and in the file "index.php" in the root directory. Then 
      the codes to include the statistics are as follows:<br />
      pictures/picture1.php: &lt;?php $set_rel_path="../stat/"; @include_once("../stat/src/include.php"); ?&gt;<br />
      index.php: &lt;?php $set_rel_path="stat/"; @include_once ("stat/src/include.php"); ?&gt;<br />
      So in $set_rel_path the relative path to the statistics is specified. A final
      slash is required. The function include_once has to be provided with the relative path to the file "include.php"
      in the statistics folder. When using this feature, it is recommended to specify $set_rel_path in all files
      (especially if register_globals is turned on).<br />
      <br />
      --- Option 2: ---<br />
      You set <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_rel_path">$config_rel_path</a> to the absolute path without the domain, starting with a slash. Example:
      "http://www.example.com/stat/" -&gt; $config_rel_path = "/stat/".<br />
      This option is not recommended and does not always work. (Not if <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_xhtml">$config_xhtml</a>=true and <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_counter_enabled">$config_counter_enabled</a>=true).<br />
      <br />
      --- Option 3: ---<br />
      You set <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_rel_path">$config_rel_path</a> to the absolute path (URI) of the statistics including the domain, e.g.
      "http://www.example.com/stat/". This option is not recommended and does not always
      work (not if <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_xhtml">$config_xhtml</a>=true and <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_counter_enabled">$config_counter_enabled</a>=true).

    <p>
      The counter was extremely accelerated, but with a few minor bugs, so it sometimes counts
      when it shouldn't (very rarely). When you call the statistics, the counter is corrected since

      responsible for the calendar to set a time. "md5.js" is responsible for transmitting the
      passwords encrypted. The files "lytebox.css" and "lytebox.js" are for "Lytebox" (modal window
      for calendar, etc.). "sortabletable.js" sort the tables by clicking on their column. The other files are
      needed for the tree view of the referer. There is no plug-in interface or the like which would

    </h3>
    <p>
      This is because CrazyStat is optimized for speed. 
      E.g. if you block by IP, most lines in the logfile can be skipped and do not have to be
      analyzed in detail which makes the analyzing a lot faster. Moreover, if you use
      caching and you change some setting (e.g. the time-span using the calendar), only the
      module which has been changed will be analyzed again.
      Thus, CrazyStat need is faster, the less settings have been changed
      and the more modules use IP blocking. Furthermore, thanks to 
      CrazyStats "Preset-File-Cache", the statistics is a lot faster when a preset is active and
      caching is enabled for it.

      You can easily add, change or remove browsers known by CrazyStat.<br />
      The file usr/keywords/browser.txt contains CrazyStat's information about browsers.
      In every line there is the "identification string" for which CrazyStat searches in
      the "User Agent String" which the browser sends (e.g. "MSIE 6").
      If the browser should not be listed under its identification string,
      but under a different name, you can add these names with an equal sign
      ("identification string=browser name"). The file "browser.txt" should have
      CHMOD 777 or at least 644 (see <a href="#faq2">FAQ</a>).

    <p>
      You can add, remove, or change robots that CrazyStat knows easily. The file "usr/keywords/robots.txt"
      contains all the identifiers of blocked robots. In every line there is the
      "identification string" of the robot which the robot sends in the "user agent". All requests that
      have a user agent which contain one of the identification strings will not be counted.
      This also applies for the browser-module where robots listed in robots.txt will not show up.
      To count all robots, simply empty the robots.txt file. You could then add robots to browser.txt
      to detect them as browsers.<br />
      Robots listed in robots.txt will also not be counted by the counter. If you change the robots.txt file,
      the next time you open show_stat.php, the counter value is adjusted (clear the cache).
      The robots.txt file should be CHMOD 777 (or at least 644).

    <p>
      In the file "usr/keywords/queryregex.txt", regular expressions can be defined that influence
      the evaluation of search terms. For each regular expression a row is created. The line begins
      with the regex (PCRE, separators (usually /) included). After a tab followed by a number
      indicating the clips, which enclose the search term. CrazyStat first checks whether the
      regular expression matches, if so, the contents of the specified clips are interpreted as the search
      term.<br />
      Example:<br />
      <br />
      /q=([^&amp;]*)&amp;.*/&nbsp;1<br />
      <i>Note that there must be a tab between */ and 1.</i>
      <br />
      This expression evaluates the contents of the parameter q as the search term (for all pages).
      The file "queryregex.txt" should have CHMOD 777 (or 644).

    <p>
      If you use XHTML files with the correct mime type ("application/xhtml+xml")
      this can cause the following problems: First, Internet Explorer will not
      be able to show your page (regardless of CrazyStat).
      Second, hits of Gecko browsers like Firefox (and possibly others) are
      counted twice by CrazyStat because these browsers load the graphics in the &lt;noscript&gt;
      area even though they have JavaScript enabled.
      To avoid this, set <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_xhtml_noscript">$config_xhtml_noscript</a> = false. However, only browsers
      that support JavaScript will then be counted.
      Mime-type text/html causes no problems when used with XHTML.

      This is technically possible but not recommended. Please ensure that you always log out

      settings, especially the IP blocking settings.

      Using <a href="config_settings_en.html#config_stat_files_preg_replace">$config_stat_files_preg_replace</a> one can perform regular expressions on the entries of the

      removes all parameters:<br />
      $config_stat_files_preg_replace=array('/\?.*/'=&gt;'');<br />
      One particular parameter can be removed like this:<br />
      $config_stat_files_preg_replace=array('/[&amp;?]PHPSESSID=[^&amp;]*/'=&gt;'');<br />
      This ensures that all PHPSESSID-parameters are removed (and their value).<br />
      Information about regular expressions can be found online.

      <a name="faq41" id="faq41">What is $config_ip_anonymous? / What are anonymized IPs?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
	  CrazyStat can anonymize the IPs of your visitors <i>before</i> writing them to the logfile. This allows you to respect your user's privacy.
	  In some countries, IP addresses are considered personal data and thefore, data privacy constraints must be obeyed to. In case
	  the law of your country requires that you anonymize IPs, or in case you simply want to respect your user's privacy, turn this feature on.
	  You will not notice any difference in CrazyStat, therefore I recommend you to turn it on in any case.<br />
	  In CrazyStat before 1.71, this setting made CrazyStat calculate a salted hash of the IP and store it instead of the actual IP.
	  Salted hashs cannot be (easily) reverted into cleartext which made this an easy but efficient approach.
	  But salted hashs do not look like IPs at all and you cannot even guess the country out of these anonymized
	  IPs. Therefore, CrazyStat 1.71 comes with a new approach: It generates an anonymized IP for each visitor
	  that looks like a normal IP and cannot be reverted to the real IP. In most cases the country can still be deteted with some accuracy, but this can also be completly wrong.
	  Country detection will be introduced before IP anonymization in upcoming versions.<br />
	  This is how anonymization is done in 1.71: The first two octets are kept unchanged (example: 111.122.133.144 -> 111.122.x.x) to make it possible
	  to detect the country with at least some accuracy. The last two octets are completely removed
	  and not kept. Then two virtual octets are calculated based on user characteristics: The third octet is calculated based on the salted hash of the
	  complete IP and the user's color depth. The fourth octet is calculated based on the salted hash of the users complete ip, the user agent
	  (browser and operating system) and the screen resolution. All this data is included to make anonymized IPs rather unique for individual visitors although
	  the two last octets are removed.<br />
	  So can the real IP be calculated from an anonymized IP? Well, you'd have to brute-force 65.536 possible IPs using the same anonymization algorithm with the data of the log entry.
	  You'd need to include your secret random salt string (this means reading usr/config_pass.php - so even if you disable password protection or use a weak password, an attacker would not be able to revert IPs).
	  So unless you have some real security problem, you are the only one who could <i>try</i> to revert IPs using brute force.
	  This is not that complicated
	  and could be done within seconds on a normal modern computer (for one IP). But the result won't help you much: You will get about 200-300 possible IPs that have the same anonymized IP. Unless you
	  have further knowledge about the visitor, it is impossible to decide which of those IPs is the real IP of the user. Please contact me if you think you found a way to work around this.<br />
	  Please also note that this is rather ridiculous: You first activate ip-anonymization and later on, you use <i>much</i> effort including brute force to revert anonymization. You could have
